- Continuous monitoring system detects and alerts on fairness violations

## Fairness Methodology

### Fairness Definitions Applied

**1. Demographic Parity**

**2. Equalized Odds**
- Definition: P(Ŷ = 1 | Y = y, A = a) equal across groups
- Metrics: False Negative Rate (FNR), False Positive Rate (FPR)
- Threshold: Gap <5 percentage points

**3. Calibration Fairness**
- Definition: P(Y = 1 | Ŷ = s, A = a) equal across groups
- Metrics: Calibration slope, intercept by subgroup
- Threshold: Slope within [0.9, 1.1], intercept within [-0.1, 0.1]

### Protected Attributes
- **Sex**: Male, Female, Other
- **Age**: <40, 40-55, 55-70, >70 years
- **Race/Ethnicity**: White, Black, Hispanic, Asian, Other

## Bias Sources & Mitigation

### Identified Bias Sources

**1. Historical Treatment Bias**
- Issue: Past prescribing patterns differ by demographics
- Impact: Model may perpetuate historical disparities
- Mitigation: Outcome-based training, not treatment-based

**2. Measurement Bias**
- Issue: Wearable accuracy varies by skin tone, activity type
- Impact: Systematic underestimation for certain groups
- Mitigation: Device-specific correction factors, multi-vendor validation

**3. Representation Bias**
- Issue: Underrepresentation of certain demographic groups
- Impact: Lower model performance for minority populations
- Mitigation: Stratified sampling, inverse propensity weighting

**4. Label Bias**
- Issue: Diagnostic coding varies by provider, institution
- Impact: Inconsistent outcome definitions across groups
- Mitigation: Standardized outcome definitions, expert review

### Mitigation Strategies Implemented

**Pre-processing**
- Inverse propensity score weighting for underrepresented groups
- Stratified train/validation splits maintaining demographic balance
- Feature selection excluding potentially discriminatory variables

**In-processing**
- Fairness constraints during model optimization
- Group-aware cross-validation to prevent overfitting to majority groups
- Regularization techniques to reduce disparate impact

**Post-processing**
- Threshold optimization by subgroup to equalize error rates
- Calibration adjustment using isotonic regression per group
- Ensemble methods combining group-specific and global models
